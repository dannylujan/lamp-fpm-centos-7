  LAMP is a software stack containing the following open-source components:
  Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  This deployment is intended for small workloads, such as a site in
  development. For a larger work load, consider using the PHP Application
  Deployment instead, as it will provide a much better setup for scaling
  production workloads.

  #### What is provided
  This deployment configures a Cloud Server running Apache, MySQL, PHP, and
  phpMyAdmin. A simple firewall rule set is configured allowing access to
  Apache and SSH.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) v2.2 is installed on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6, CentOS 6, Debian 7, Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04. Ubuntu 14.04 and CentOS 7
  come with Apache 2.4.

  [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) v5.1 is installed on Ubuntu 10.04. MySQL v5.5
  is installed on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, Redhat Enterprise Linux 6 and CentOS 6.
  [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) is the default on CentOS 7.

  The MySQL root password is recorded in root's home directory in the
  file .my.cnf and in the View Generated Passwords dialog. Daily database
  backups are taken using [Holland](http://hollandbackup.org/). A rotating
  seven days of database dumps are stored in /var/lib/mysqlbackup.

  [PHP](http://www.php.net/) is installed at v5.3 on Ubuntu 12.04, v5.4 on
  Redhat Enterprise Linux 6, CentOS 6 and Debian 7, v5.5 on Ubuntu 14.04,
  and v5.6 on CentOS 7,

  [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is available via HTTP at
  /phpmyadmin. Apache is configured to require HTTP basic authentication. Log
  in as the user specified when deploying (the default is `admin`) with the
  password displayed in the View Generated Passwords dialog. You may then login
  using MySQL login credentials which are also available in the View Generated
  Passwords dialog.
